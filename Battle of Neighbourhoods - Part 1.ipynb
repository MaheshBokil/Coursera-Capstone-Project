We may find customers who may absolutely like the idea of a particular type of restaurant or totally not like it. Your business will depend on the like/ dislike of people. We often find such examples. One also needs to be cautious about the look and feel of the restaurant. Also, marketing says that we should start our new business in a new area, but research has shown otherwise. That is why we find clustering of restaurant-areas, business-areas, IT areas etc. If you adequately define your restaurant\u2019s look and feel while also identifying the location, you would do well. \nPlanning."
